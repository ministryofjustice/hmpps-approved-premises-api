  /**
   * Returns all active bookings created in delius that were not created in CAS1, using the data in
   * the [Cas1DeliusBookingImportEntity] table
   *
   * An active booking is one that:
   *
   * 1. does not have a departure recorded (and optionally, no arrival recorded)
   * 2. does not have a non arrival recorded
   *
   * We also exclude any bookings where the departure date is before 1/1/2025 or after 1/1/2035.
   * This filters out several bookings where the dates have been set incorrectly but are clearly inactive/complete,
   * most likely because they were created in older versions of delius that did not capture this data
   *
   * Note that the [Cas1DeliusBookingImportEntity] table only includes accepted bookings (i.e. not rejected),
   * so these are already filtered out. It also doesn't include cancelled bookings, because these are deleted
   * in delius
