   *
   * Ideally we'd model the request for these dates as a subtype of [PlacementApplicationEntity].
   * Unfortunately, it's non-trivial to amend the data model and workflow implementation
   * to allow us to use [PlacementApplicationEntity] for this purpose.
   *
   * Note that we do populated [PlacementApplicationAutomaticEntity] to support reporting on
   * such requests. This could maybe be used as a starting point to fix the data model.
   *
   * For Withdrawal functionality we have a use-case for the user to be able to withdraw the original
   * application dates without withdrawing the whole application and/or assessment.
   *
   * Without a first class entity to represent these dates, we have instead elected to use
   * the [PlacementRequestEntity] that was created for these dates to represent this yet unrealised entity.
   *
   * Whilst not ideal, this gives us a tangible and addressable entity against which:
   *
   * 1) The user can request withdrawals
   * 2) We can raise domain events
   * 3) We can send emails
   *
   * To achieve the aforementioned facade we present such instances of [PlacementRequestEntity] as a
   * 'Request for Placement' whenever presented to user, whether in a list of withdrawable elements,
   * being described on the domain event timeline, or being mentioned in an email on withdrawal
   *
