        As we trust the XLSX files we import, we are safe to ignore this vulnerability

        note that there isn't currently a version of dataframe-excel that use a version
        of POI that resolves this issue. Once there is, we should upgrade to it and
        remove this suppression

        of concern. This should be resolved in a newer version of
        uk.gov.justice.hmpps.gradle-spring-boot when it includes a version
